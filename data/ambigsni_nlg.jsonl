When it comes to temperature, it is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the temperature, the more energy the particles have and the faster they will move and diffuse. This movement of particles is what causes substances to change from one state to another, such as from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. One important aspect to understand is that as the particles in a substance move faster, the substance's temperature increases, and as they move slower, the temperature decreases.

This is crucial in order to avoid subjecting unfit patients to potentially harmful treatments, and to ensure that those who are fit for aggressive therapy receive the most appropriate care. The use of a simple comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) has been proposed as a potential solution to this challenge. In a recent study, the effectiveness of CGA in identifying elderly DLCL patients who can be effectively treated with anthracycline-containing immunochemotherapy was analyzed. The study involved 84 consecutive patients aged >65 years, and the results showed that the CGA was indeed effective in determining the suitability of aggressive therapy.
