This repository contains AmbigSNI_NLG dataset, developed for the study '*AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG.*'

This dataset includes the ambiguity categories and their corresponding additional instructions to mitigate each ambiguity.
It was constructed through an LLM-in-the-loop annotation process on the [Super-natural instructions benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07705).

See full details in the paper: [AmbigNLG: Addressing Task Ambiguity in Instruction for NLG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17717).

## ðŸ”§ AmbigNLG setup

Install dependencies, download the raw dataset of [Super-natural instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07705), and then build AmbigSNI_NLG dataset.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash ./scripts/setup_data.sh
OUTPUT_PATH=XXXXX.jsonl; python ./scripts/setup.py --output_path $OUTPUT_PATH
```

## ðŸŒ² Dataset Structure

`data/ambigsni_nlg.jsonl` file comprises 2,500 instances. Each instance is a dictionary with the following keys:

| Key                       | Explanation                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                      | The unique identifier for each instance.                                                                                            |    
| `ambiguity_categories`    | List of assigned ambiguity categories (`planning`, `keywords`, `context`, `style`, `theme`, or `length`) assigned to each instance. | 
| `additional_instructions` | The additional instruction for each assigned ambiguity category.                                                                    | 
| `split`                   | Dataset split usage (`demonstration` or `test`)                                                                                     | 

The data was constructed by LLM-in-the-loop annotation approach, where we manually curate and verify the dataset by guiding the LLMâ€™s generation.

Please refer to the details in Section 4 of our paper.

**Example Instance**

```json
{
  "id": "task1598-4e8b21aebcc54e61b232f9d14c43e09d",
  "ambiguity_categories": ["keywords"],
  "additional_instructions": {
    "planning": null,
    "keywords": "Include ['xname coffee shop', 'moderately priced', 'xnear', 'food'] in your response.",
    "context": null,
    "style": null,
    "theme": null,
    "length": null
  },
  "split": "test"
}
